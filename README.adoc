# Raketeneinhorn Spring Boot Tracing Demo

A project demonstrating remote tracing with Spring Boot services and the Grafana stack. Also shows how to do remote logging and provide metrics with Spring Boot.

## Context

This project has been setup to do a live demonstration of remote tracing, remote logging and metrics with Spring Boot.

## How to run

 mvn clean install spring-boot:build-image
 docker-compose --project-directory docker-compose up

[NOTE]
====
* `mvn clean` usually is not necessary.
* `mvn install` is needed to due to some complicated mvn setup which might be solved soonâ„¢.

## Limitations

The code itself is far from being polished. It should be good enough to give you an idea on how to implement remote tracing in your own Spring Boot services.

## ToDo

* Use https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry] instead of Zipkin as the backend for Sleuth.
* Configure Tempo to receive Open Telemetry data.
* Configure service graphs in Grafana.
* Check if `-Dorg.springframework.cloud.bindings.boot.enable=true` can and should be disabled.

## Questions

* What is the recommended way to attach additional data to a trace?
